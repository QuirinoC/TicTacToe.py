TicTacToe in python for 2 players
 Feel free to download and play tictactoe.py, its written in python3 
 Just python3 tictactoe.py in terminal
I still have to work in play again in case its a tie or someone winning
Please ask me any questions you have about how to do something

-Fixed The play again, now you can play again without restarting the program
-Fixed a bug that caused the winner to get double turn in the next game
